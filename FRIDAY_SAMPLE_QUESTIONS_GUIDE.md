## üí° **TIPS FOR BETTER RESPONSES**

### ‚úÖ **Best Practices**
- Be specific about what aspect you want analyzed
- Use natural language - the AI understands context
- Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper
- Combine multiple data points in your questions
- Reference specific MD5 hashes when possible

### ‚ö° **Quick Commands**
- Type "stop" during speech to interrupt TTS
- Use shorter MD5 prefixes (e.g., "75dddb" instead of full hash)
- Ask "show fields for <MD5>" to see available data fields
- Use "exit" to quit the speak mode

### üéØ **Query Types That Work Well**
- **Analytical**: "Analyze the..." "What patterns..."  
- **Comparative**: "Compare this to..." "How does this differ..."
- **Explanatory**: "Explain why..." "How does this work..."
- **Predictive**: "What might happen..." "How could this evolve..."
- **Actionable**: "What should I do..." "How can I defend..."
